"""Run the mutation lens against a real test command.

For each single-point mutant of the changed region, the source file is replaced
in place, the caller's test command is run, and the mutant is recorded as
*killed* (the command failed or timed out) or *survived* (it still passed). The
original bytes are always restored, including on errors and Ctrl-C. A process
killed with SIGKILL cannot restore — run on a clean git tree.

Two honesty guards fail closed instead of reporting a score:

- the test command must pass on the untouched source (a red baseline would
  make every "kill" meaningless);
- a *null mutant* — the module re-serialised by ``ast.unparse`` with no
  mutation — must also pass, so a kill is caused by the fault, not formatting.

Bytecode caching is disabled for every run: a same-size mutant written within
the same second as the previous run would otherwise execute a stale ``.pyc``
of different code and falsely survive.

A hanging mutant counts as killed, as in standard mutation testing: CI would
time the suite out and fail.
